# SequenceEnum
There are 3 C++ classes, SequenceEnum, SeqExtract, and SpasEnum. SequenceEnum is the parent/base class and SeqExtract and SpasEnum are the child/derived classes. The classes will take a string and modify it in different ways according to the class. The intent of these classes is to demonstrate encapsulation and inheritance.
